# JavaScript Conditional Expressions Challenge
In this challenge, you are required to implement a function that evaluates conditional expressions in JavaScript. The task is to create a function called `evaluateExpression` that takes a string as input and evaluates it as a conditional expression. The function should return `true` if the expression is true, and `false` otherwise.

## Setup
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Testing
Run `npm test` to run the tests and validate your solution.
